# WELCOME TO THE HUNT
Goal:
The goal of this 'Hunt' is to find the final message. You will know when you have it.
Using the files provided and any other resources needed, you need to find this message. 
On your way, you will find a series of passwords required to continue to the next section of the hunt. 
When you find such a password, make sure to save it somewhere and to enter it into the password prompt (main.exe).
I swear that none of/nothing in any of these resources are any form of malware or damaging program.

Rules:
1. Nothing. There are no rules. You can do anything you need to do to finish this challenge. Push, pull, and pry every file as much as you need.
